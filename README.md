# Idle-Helper
NodeJS Idle Helper / Idler for Steam games

You guys will need to test this / get it all working, I'll happily merge any changes, I'm tired of the whole NodeJS idle shit and I couldn't care about the two factor auth at all, what these repo currently consists of is a striped down version of my NodeJS Idle Manager that ran using socket.io, obviously all the socket stuff is removed.
